# glfw-bootcamp
Let's learn GLFW

---

## First attempt to learn OpenGL (following the work of a friend of mine)
To compile program first run
- `make base` and `make struct` to create basic strcture
- `make objects` to build all objects
- `make` to build default target
or run `make project` to run all previous command at once
