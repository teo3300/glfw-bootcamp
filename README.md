Let's learn GLFW

---

## First attempt to learn OpenGL (following the work of a friend of mine)

To compile program first run
- `make base` and `make struct` to create basic strcture
- `make objects` to build all objects
- `make project` to run all previous command at once
- `make` does the same as `make project`
- `make rebuild` delete all compiled an rebuild the whole project
